## Next action
Write docs/SPEC.md from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md scoped to Neel's area (backend/integration + shared data contract), put the design forks to the user, then GATE 1.

## Waiting on user
Design forks for backend/contract (see chat).

## Notes for a fresh session
- Team of 4: iOS (RoomPlan app, LiDAR iPhone + Xcode Mac available), physics engine (teammate, in progress), SerpApi products (teammate, in progress), Neel = backend/integration (FastAPI, Vultr, Caddy, .tech, Gemini, contract, pairing) + planning.
- Orchestrated scope = Neel's area plus the shared JSON contract. Teammates' parts are developed outside this orchestration and plug in via docs/API.md.
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is the seed context; sections 5-8 hold the contract, pairing and engine proposals.
