## Next action
Wave 3 merged (lint, products-adapter, integrate; demo-ok at 54bb9b1); master verified: `python -m ruff check . && python -m pytest -q` = 273 passed; config.json test now includes ruff. Push master, then on the server: `cd /srv/sweetspot && git pull && docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build` (keys already in /srv/sweetspot/.env), then `bash deploy/smoke.sh https://144-202-27-51.sslip.io` and `python tools/e2e.py https://144-202-27-51.sslip.io`; verify live Gemini model name (gemini-2.5-flash) via materials and live SerpApi expansion. Then GATE 6 prep: integration phase leftovers = web app (webapp/, teammate), real iOS scan, DEMO.md rehearsal.

## Waiting on user
Nothing blocking. Later: tell the SerpApi teammate their files moved to products/catalog.py and search.py; tell the web teammate products items carry `dimensions` (feet, listing-parsed or default) and `pair_with` for AR; 3D model teammate can read the same room/layout JSON.

## SerpApi integration (merged on master; products-adapter merged 20:24, so the backend now loads `products` instead of the stub)
- origin/serp merged; teammate files moved to products/catalog.py, products/search.py, products/av_prices.db (2,866 listings), only change = `from . import catalog`. products/__init__.py is a docstring until products-adapter lands (backend falls back to the stub meanwhile). requests + python-dotenv pinned. ruff excludes the two teammate files.
- docs/API.md section 4 rewritten with the user's decisions (DB first, expansion if fewer than 3 matches, filters, role mapping, front-weighted value pick, pairs with pair_with, specs + dimensions in feet). Tell the teammate their files moved (1a, user approved).

## Wave 3 (done 21:00: lint, integrate, products-adapter merged)
- products-adapter: brief encodes the value formula (q = rating + spec parts; maximise q - 0.35 price/share), dimension parsing + defaults, deadline-bound expansion thread (PRODUCTS_EXPAND_DEADLINE_S=20).
- lint: ruff.toml + ruff==0.17.2 already committed on master by the orchestrator (about 150 findings, mostly tools/validate_dto.py and backend/tests/contract/). Worker fixes findings behaviour-preserving.
- integrate: tools/e2e.py (run_e2e(client) + CLI), backend/tests/e2e (in-process + live-marked), DEMO.md with failure drills. Must itself pass ruff.
- Codex: account 1 at 21%; account 2 = CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-second (PowerShell profile function codex2). Dispatch inherits CODEX_HOME from the calling shell.

## Built and merged (master, pushed; local tag demo-ok at ac6a154; GitHub's demo-ok tag is stale because a force push was declined)
- Tasks done: core-api, materials, contracts, roomplan, deploy, plot2d (/app/plot2d/), engine-adapter (backend/app/engine_speakerplacer.py + acoustics.py) around the teammate `speakerplacer` engine.
- Full suite: `python -m pytest -q` = 249 passed (about 75 s).
- Web app is SPEC only: webapp_context/ README + 01-07 + sample payloads. Stack: React + Vite, base /app/, built into web/ at deploy.

## Live deployment
- https://144-202-27-51.sslip.io on VPS 144.202.27.51 (Ubuntu 26.04, root SSH key works from this machine, Docker, ufw 22/80/443, 8 GB swap). Repo /srv/sweetspot (pull before rebuild). .env mode 600 with DOMAIN/SITE_ADDRESS = 144-202-27-51.sslip.io, DATA_DIR=/data, keys empty. Caddy cert valid to 2027-01-22. smoke.sh all PASS; optimize ~8 s; `/` redirects to /app/plot2d/.

## Notes for a fresh session
- Team: iOS (phoneapp_context/), engine teammate (speakerplacer, merged), SerpApi teammate (products/ NOT delivered; backend uses the stub), web teammate (webapp_context/). Neel = backend/integration + planning.
- Lint policy: ruff (py312, line 120, E F W I B UP), speakerplacer + tests/test_speakerplacer.py excluded (teammate code); no tree-wide `ruff format` mid-hackathon.
- When webapp/ lands: Node build stage in deploy/Dockerfile (copy webapp/dist into web/), .dockerignore webapp/node_modules + webapp/dist, Caddy root redirect /app/plot2d/ -> /app/, backend/tests/test_web_app.py (skips without a build).
- When products/ lands: contract tests (real products only under -m live); the adapter loads `products` automatically.
- When the real iOS scan arrives: replace fixtures/roomplan_sample.json, run tools/validate_dto.py and the roomplan tests.
- Known gaps: speakerplacer has no center model (adapter places C geometrically); Gemini model is gemini-3.8-flash (2.5 retired); Gemini account credits depleted (402) until the user tops up AI Studio; no .tech domain yet.
- Tooling gotchas: dispatcher shell resolves `bash` to the WSL launcher (system32\bash.EXE, exit 127): tests must not require it; first account-2 Codex run triggers ~10 UAC prompts (one-time); Codex sandbox leaves locked `.<task>-run/` dirs (git-excluded); worker timeoutSec 1800; `run-wave` only starts `ready` tasks; commit DECISIONS.md before `dispatch merge`; never force-push; Bash-tool heredocs with long markdown fail: use the Write tool; `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for `git show rev:path`.
- Models per user: gpt-6-sol / gpt-5.6-luna default, gpt-5.6-terra when the user asks, gpt-6-astra only for the hardest.
