## Next action
GATE 1 passed? Then draft docs/API.md (contract + engine/products adapter signatures), AGENTS.md, config.json test cmd, TASKS.md, and hit GATE 2.

## Waiting on user
GATE 1: approve docs/SPEC.md or request changes; answer the open questions at the bottom of it.

## Notes for a fresh session
- Team of 4: iOS (RoomPlan app, LiDAR iPhone + Xcode Mac available), physics engine (teammate, in progress), SerpApi products (teammate, in progress), Neel = backend/integration (FastAPI, Vultr, Caddy, .tech, Gemini, contract, pairing) + planning.
- Orchestrated scope = Neel's area plus the shared JSON contract. Teammates' parts are developed outside this orchestration and plug in via docs/API.md.
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is the seed context; sections 5-8 hold the contract, pairing and engine proposals.
