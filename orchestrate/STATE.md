## Next action
products-options retry 1 finished: check PASS, review ISSUES again (5 edge-case findings: dedupe refill of cheaper/pricier alternative, front detection when L missing, surround must differ from C too, alternatives must use the contextual filtered candidates, model_key must strip ALL punctuation). Second ISSUES -> user decides: (A) merge now with override and fold the 5 findings into the next recommend.py task, (B) another retry. Nothing deployed: the VPS runs the products-spend build and lacks the ios-real-scan fix; the user wants the deploy to wait for the home-theater products version (receiver, passive speakers only, projector-first display, TV only if budget allows) unless told otherwise. Proposed tasks, all pending user go: products-theater (home-theater roles + tv rule, API.md section 4 change), polygon-geometry then polygon-engine (non-rectangular rooms: `outline` in Room JSON, converter, point-in-polygon, plot2d, `POST /rooms/polygon`, then adapter + acoustics). Existing wave-8 todo tasks from the user's other session: roomplan-tv, plot2d-patch-depth, ios-shop-push (iOS branch rule), polygon-walls (blocked, to be replaced by the two polygon tasks). Design forks resolved earlier are marked [resolved] in the HANDOFFs.

## Waiting on user
1. products-options: merge with override (A) or retry (B)? 2. Answers to the home-theater questions (items in the setup, receiver rules, passive-only speaker filter, extra SerpApi queries) and the TV-as-swap question. 3. Go on polygon-geometry / polygon-engine and gpt-6-sol high. 4. Whether to deploy the ios-real-scan fix to the VPS now. 5. Build ios-phone_context in Xcode (full room scan needed).

## SerpApi integration (merged on master; products-adapter merged 20:24, so the backend now loads `products` instead of the stub)
- origin/serp merged; teammate files moved to products/catalog.py, products/search.py, products/av_prices.db (2,866 listings), only change = `from . import catalog`. products/__init__.py is a docstring until products-adapter lands (backend falls back to the stub meanwhile). requests + python-dotenv pinned. ruff excludes the two teammate files.
- docs/API.md section 4 rewritten with the user's decisions (DB first, expansion if fewer than 3 matches, filters, role mapping, front-weighted value pick, pairs with pair_with, specs + dimensions in feet). Tell the teammate their files moved (1a, user approved).

## Waves 3-4 (done: lint, integrate, products-adapter, products-spend)
- products-adapter: brief encodes the value formula (q = rating + spec parts; maximise q - 0.35 price/share), dimension parsing + defaults, deadline-bound expansion thread (PRODUCTS_EXPAND_DEADLINE_S=20).
- lint: ruff.toml + ruff==0.17.2 already committed on master by the orchestrator (about 150 findings, mostly tools/validate_dto.py and backend/tests/contract/). Worker fixes findings behaviour-preserving.
- integrate: tools/e2e.py (run_e2e(client) + CLI), backend/tests/e2e (in-process + live-marked), DEMO.md with failure drills. Must itself pass ruff.
- Codex: account 1 at 21%; account 2 = CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-second (PowerShell profile function codex2). Dispatch inherits CODEX_HOME from the calling shell.

## Built and merged (master, pushed; local tag demo-ok at ac6a154; GitHub's demo-ok tag is stale because a force push was declined)
- Tasks done: core-api, materials, contracts, roomplan, deploy, plot2d (/app/plot2d/), engine-adapter (backend/app/engine_speakerplacer.py + acoustics.py) around the teammate `speakerplacer` engine.
- Full suite: `python -m pytest -q` = 249 passed (about 75 s).
- Web app is SPEC only: webapp_context/ README + 01-07 + sample payloads. Stack: React + Vite, base /app/, built into web/ at deploy.

## Live deployment
- https://144-202-27-51.sslip.io on VPS 144.202.27.51 (Ubuntu 26.04, root SSH key works from this machine, Docker, ufw 22/80/443, 8 GB swap). Repo /srv/sweetspot (pull before rebuild). .env mode 600 with DOMAIN/SITE_ADDRESS = 144-202-27-51.sslip.io, DATA_DIR=/data, keys empty. Caddy cert valid to 2027-01-22. smoke.sh all PASS; optimize ~8 s; `/` redirects to /app/plot2d/.

## Notes for a fresh session
- Team: iOS (phoneapp_context/), engine teammate (speakerplacer, merged), SerpApi teammate (products/ NOT delivered; backend uses the stub), web teammate (webapp_context/). Neel = backend/integration + planning.
- Lint policy: ruff (py312, line 120, E F W I B UP), speakerplacer + tests/test_speakerplacer.py excluded (teammate code); no tree-wide `ruff format` mid-hackathon.
- When webapp/ lands: Node build stage in deploy/Dockerfile (copy webapp/dist into web/), .dockerignore webapp/node_modules + webapp/dist, Caddy root redirect /app/plot2d/ -> /app/, backend/tests/test_web_app.py (skips without a build).
- When products/ lands: contract tests (real products only under -m live); the adapter loads `products` automatically.
- When the real iOS scan arrives: replace fixtures/roomplan_sample.json, run tools/validate_dto.py and the roomplan tests.
- Known gaps: speakerplacer has no center model (adapter places C geometrically); Gemini model is gemini-3.8-flash (2.5 retired), credits added and verified; no .tech domain yet.
- Tooling gotchas: dispatcher shell resolves `bash` to the WSL launcher (system32\bash.EXE, exit 127): tests must not require it; first account-2 Codex run triggers ~10 UAC prompts (one-time); Codex sandbox leaves locked `.<task>-run/` dirs (git-excluded); worker timeoutSec 1800; `run-wave` only starts `ready` tasks; commit DECISIONS.md before `dispatch merge`; never force-push; Bash-tool heredocs with long markdown fail: use the Write tool; `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for `git show rev:path`.
- Codex accounts (user rule): with 2+ tasks, spread workers across account 1 (CODEX_HOME unset) and account 2 (CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-second) using parallel `start -Id` calls, then `review -Id`; run-wave alone uses one account.
- Codex UAC: stagger worker starts across the two accounts (start one, wait ~30 s until its first command ran, then start the next) because both accounts share the sandbox users; fallback idea: `[windows] sandbox = "unelevated"` in both config.toml (user decision pending).
- Deploy rule (user): once backend merges are complete, push master and redeploy the VPS (git pull + docker compose up -d --build), then smoke.sh and tools/e2e.py against https://144-202-27-51.sslip.io.
- Models per user: gpt-6-sol / gpt-5.6-luna default, gpt-5.6-terra when the user asks, gpt-6-astra only for the hardest.
